    "# Introduction\n",
    "Companies that deal with a large volume of products - such as distributors, industries and retail chains - often face the challenge of identifying products based on inaccurate, incomplete or varied textual descriptions. In environments where data is entered manually, typos, abbreviations and different trade names can make it difficult to correctly identify items in systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and e-commerce platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, there is a common need for tools that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpret informal or incorrect descriptions provided by users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggest the most similar products based on semantic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guarantee a fallback with traditional algorithms (such as fuzzy matching) if the semantic search does not find relevant results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrate with APIs and automated flows of intelligent agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to create an AI agent specialized in resolving inconsistencies in customer return invoices. The agent is able to interact with an MCP server that provides vector search and invoice retrieval tools, allowing the agent to automatically find the company's original A/R invoice based on information provided by the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A MCP Server (Model Context Protocol) is a software component responsible for mediating communication between intelligent agents and external services through a standardized protocol of messages and tools. It acts as a bridge between language models (LLMs) and existing APIs, allowing AI agents to access specific functionalities of legacy systems without the need to rewrite or directly adapt them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The MCP server:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exposes a set of named tools that represent actions or services agents can call.\n",
    "Each tool can be connected to a database function, REST API, legacy system, or any programmable operation.\n",
    "Receives agent commands (in JSON format), executes the corresponding service, and returns a standardized response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage with Legacy Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Legacy applications often already provide functionality through databases, files, or internal APIs. With a MCP Server, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulate calls to REST services, stored procedures, or SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make these services accessible to an agent through a unified communication interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrate older systems with modern architectures based on conversational AI and RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "Reuse of existing business logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "No need to refactor legacy systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enables LLM agents to interact with external systems in a secure and controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Facilitates testing, versioning, and modularity in the integration between AI and backend services.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Google Generative AI** (Gemini 2.0 Flash) - Language model and embeddings for semantic search\n",
    "- **Oracle Database 23ai (Free)** - Local or Oracle Free Cloud database for data storage and vector indexing\n",
    "- **MCP Server** (FastMCP) - Single stdio-based server providing three tools for invoice resolution\n",
    "- **Custom Agent Loop** - Pure Python ReAct agent implementation with Gemini API\n",
    "\n",
    "This modular design eliminates unnecessary framework dependencies (no LangChain/LangGraph required) and leverages Gemini's native tool-calling capabilities for efficient agent orchestration.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objectives\n",
    "Build a completely independent MCP-based agent without LangChain or LangGraph dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrate the agent with a local MCP server using the stdio protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use an MCP server with three tools:\n",
    "- Perform vector searches from product descriptions using Gemini embeddings.\n",
    "- Identify the most likely EAN code for an item using advanced SQL search.\n",
    "- Search for original invoices based on customer, state, EAN, and price criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulate a real problem resolution based on a JSON input such as:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"customer\": \"Customer 43\",\n",
    "  \"description\": \"Harry Potter\",\n",
    "  \"price\": 139.55,\n",
    "  \"location\": \"RJ\"\n",
